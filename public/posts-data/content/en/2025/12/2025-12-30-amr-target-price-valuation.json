Introduction: Why 'Status Quo' Equals 'Value Appreciation'</h2>\n<p>This report calculates AMR's target price assuming that current revenue realization prices and margin rates remain constant going forward. While most companies see stock prices stagnate when growth stops, AMR's aggressive <strong>share count reduction through share repurchases</strong> strategy means that maintaining the status quo itself leads to mechanical per-share value appreciation.</p>\n<p>All figures and citations are based on <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001704715/000170471525000042/amr-20250930.htm\">AMR 2025 Q3 10-Q disclosure materials</a> and market data as of December 30, 2025.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>1. Fair Value Calculation Based on Valuation Metrics</h2>\n<h3>[Table 1] Key Metrics for Fair Value Calculation (2025 Q3 Basis)</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Metric</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Value</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Notes</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Current Share Price</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>$205.40</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">As of 2025-12-30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>BPS (Book Value per Share)</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>$123.23</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Total equity $1.59B / Shares outstanding 12.9M</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Current P/B Ratio</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>1.67x</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Current multiple assigned by the market</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Annual Expected FCF</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>$110M ~ $150M</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Annual estimate based on 9-month cumulative FCF</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Justification from P/B (Price-to-Book) Perspective</h3>\n<p>AMR's current P/B ratio of 1.67x is at a reasonable level between the high multiples of past coal industry booms and the lows of downturns. Considering that the net cash position ($453M) enhances capital quality and the company is nearly debt-free, a rerating to <strong>P/B 1.8x ~ 2.0x</strong> is within a conservative range.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>2. Target Price Calculation Scenarios</h2>\n<h3>Scenario A: P/B Rerating (Target P/B 2.0x)</h3>\n<p>This is the target price if the asset value multiple assigned by the market rises to 2.0x, considering AMR's asset health and net cash proportion.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Formula:</strong> BPS $123.23 × Target P/B 2.0 = <strong>$246.46</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Upside Potential:</strong> <strong>+20%</strong> vs. current price</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Scenario B: Capital Compression Reflection (Assuming 8% Share Count Reduction After 12 Months)</h3>\n<p>AMR management has been executing share repurchases of approximately $150M~$200M annually. Assuming shares equivalent to about 7~8% of current market cap ($2.65B) are retired, per-share value rises even if earnings and capital remain unchanged.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Expected Share Count:</strong> Approximately 11.9 million shares (8% decrease from current 12.92 million)</li>\n<li><strong>Adjusted BPS:</strong> $1.59B / 11.9M = <strong>$133.61</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Target Price (Applying P/B 1.8x):</strong> $133.61 × 1.8 = <strong>$240.50</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>3. Management's Assertions and Rationale</h2>\n<p>According to business reports and earnings releases, management maintains a strategy of increasing production share from high-margin mines to preserve current margin rates.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Our metallurgical segment's cost of coal sold per ton for the third quarter was $107.01... reflecting our continued focus on operational efficiency and cost management.\"<br>\n— <em>AMR 2025 Q3 Management's Discussion and Analysis</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, even if revenue does not explode, the virtuous cycle of 'cost control → margin maintenance → cash generation → share repurchase → per-share value appreciation' is the key driver for reaching the target price.</p>\n<p>Management justifies this strategy as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program, which we believe represents the most attractive investment opportunity available to us.\"<br>\n— <em>AMR 2025 Q3 Earnings Call</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2>4. Final Conclusion: Target Price <strong>$245.00</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rationale 1:</strong> If current cost control capability ($107.01/ton) is maintained, annual FCF generation of over $100M is assured.</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale 2:</strong> If generated FCF is invested in share repurchases, book value per share (BPS) will naturally increase by approximately 8~10% within one year.</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale 3:</strong> Net cash-based debt-free management serves as a factor that defends or elevates P/B multiples to the 2.0x level during market volatility.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In conclusion, as long as management's capital allocation policy continues, <strong>$245.00 (approximately +20% vs. current price)</strong> is a financially justifiable target even if revenue growth stagnates.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p><strong>3Q2025 Business Report:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001704715/000170471525000042/amr-20250930.htm\">Alpha Metallurgical Resources 2025 Q3 10-Q (SEC Filing)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Other Materials:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>AMR Investor Relations Earnings Materials</li>\n<li>Market Price Data (2025-12-30)</li>\n</ul>\n"
