    "content": "\nI had long believed that past events came together to create who I am now. But understanding the moment lightning strikes the ground completely reversed my thinking.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Time Flowing Backward: The Result Chose My Past\n\nAmong countless electrical charges descending from the cloud, the moment a single one connects with the ground, all other paths disappear, and only that path becomes confirmed as 'the path of lightning.'\n\nThat's when I realized. The moment I firmly decided what future version of myself I would become, my past wanderings and suffering were no longer failures. They were re-selected within me as the **'inevitable path'** that was absolutely necessary to create that result.\n\n> \"Causes don't create results; results choose causes.\"\n\nThis sentence was not merely a paradox to me, but a message of salvation that allowed me to rewrite my life.\n\nInstead of despairing that I cannot change the past, I discovered the possibility of **redefining the meaning of the past by first claiming the future result**. This became the first method I began to try.\n\n---\n\n## 2. I Didn't Come to Make Choices; I Came to Understand Them\n\nThe words the Oracle threw at Neo in *The Matrix* quenched my long thirst regarding my calling.\n\n> **The Oracle:** \"You didn't come here to make the choice. You've already made it. You're here to try to understand why you made it.\"\n\nI was always lost, not knowing what I should do, but I came to realize that my deep self (Deep Self) had already decided on **'a more authentic me'**.\n\n### What I Tried\n\nAll my attempts were not a process of finding new answers, but a process of discovering the **'reasons'** one by one to unfold that massive decision I had already made into reality.\n\nAccepting this fact, my daunting attempts began to transform into excitement. Instead of asking \"What should I do?\", I began asking: **\"What had I already chosen?\"**\n\nA mentor once said something that comes to mind: \"You already know. It's just hard to admit it. Try this once. Instead of asking what you really want, ask what you've already chosen.\"\n\n---\n\n## 3. The Criterion for Confirming What Is 'Truly Me': The MOST Test\n\nWhenever I was confused about what was truly me and what was false, I recalled the **MOST (Mirror-of-the-Self Test)** proposed by Christopher Alexander.\n\nHe would show students two objects and always ask them this:\n\n> **Alexander:** \"Which one reflects more of your whole self? If you had to become one of these objects, which one would make your soul more at ease?\"\n\n### Practical Method\n\nI, too, began asking myself this question before calculating what benefit a choice would bring.\n\n| Question Style | Effect |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Old Way:** \"What benefit will this choice bring me?\" | Hell of calculation and comparison, endless worry |\n| **MOST Way:** \"Does this choice reflect more of my whole self?\" | Immediate intuition, peace of mind |\n\nWhen I made choices that made me most authentically myself, they transmitted positive vitality not only to me but also to those around me. The mirror that reflected me most deeply was ultimately connected to the universal order that humanity feels in common.\n\nA friend once said something I remember: \"When you made that decision, I felt something ease up too. I can't explain it, but it felt 'right'.\"\n\n---\n\n## 4. The Tool That Expands Choices: My Own Checklist\n\nI love witnessing the moment when someone's choices, narrowed down, suddenly expand brightly through conversation. That's when I feel alive. My calling was precisely in that **'work of expanding choices'**.\n\nI decided to center the concept of **'checklist'** to implement this value as a concrete business. The checklist I envision is not simply a list of things to do.\n\n> \"We are not making forms; we are helping forms unfold themselves.\" - Christopher Alexander\n\nLike this saying, my checklist is like **the Oracle's finger**, picking out essential things from complex chaos and reopening closed possibilities.\n\n### Structure of the Checklist\n\nI wanted to help people return to a state of **'infinite choice'** through this tangible tool. The checklist I created consists of the following questions:\n\n1. **Result Claiming Question:** \"If I were already in the state of having achieved it, what sensation would I be feeling right now?\"\n2. **MOST Question:** \"Does this choice reflect more of my whole self?\"\n3. **Understanding Question:** \"What had I already chosen? What was the reason?\"\n\nA client once said something that comes to mind: \"Going through this checklist one by one, I felt something blocked inside me release. I could see again what I had originally known.\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. The New Trajectory of Life I'm Trying\n\nI decided not to trap myself in narrow frameworks by worrying about 'how' to live. Instead, I'm continuing with the following new attempts.\n\n### Practical Methods\n\n#### 1. Claiming the Result First\n\nI pre-experience the sensation of my calling already being fulfilled, right at this moment. Every morning, I close my eyes for five minutes and imagine what it would feel like if I had already completed my calling.\n\n> \"Because I choose to\" - Neo\n\nRepeating this sentence, I experience the sensation of the result I've already chosen, right now.\n\n#### 2. Looking at the Mirror That Reflects Me\n\nI ask the MOST question whether each moment's choice projects my essence. Now, whenever I make a decision, before creating a calculation sheet, I first ask my heart: \"Does this choice make me more authentically myself?\"\n\n#### 3. Unfolding Through Checklist\n\nI make a list of questions that awaken my essence and check them off one by one. Each time I check off a question, I rediscover something I had already known.\n\nA colleague once said something I remember: \"Watching you check things off one by one like that, I feel like I could try something too. It's not complicated—just answering questions one by one, right?\"\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Conclusion: When Choices Expand, Vitality Flows\n\nWhen my choices expanded, my vitality finally began to flow without obstruction. Today, I continue unfolding my calling one by one on the canvas that is Canada.\n\nI hope this article becomes a small window for someone reading it to try **'another attempt'** beyond the methods they already had.\n\n### Summary of What I've Tried\n\n| Method | Core | Practice |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Claiming Results** | First decide the future result, then let that result choose the past | Feel the sensation of the completed state for 5 minutes every morning |\n| **Understanding** | Not finding new choices, but discovering the reasons for choices already made | Instead of \"What should I do?\", ask \"What had I already chosen?\" |\n| **MOST Test** | Instead of calculating benefits, check if it reflects my whole self | Before choosing, ask \"Does this make me more authentically myself?\" |\n| **Checklist** | Pick out the essence from complex chaos and reopen choices | Make a list of questions that awaken essence and check them off one by one |\n\nA mentor once said something that comes to mind: \"The best advice is what makes you see again what you already knew. It's not teaching you something new; it's reminding you of what you had forgotten.\"\n\n**My mirror is now reflecting the future I dreamed of.**\n\n---\n\n**Next Step:** I'll choose one decision I'll make today. Before making that decision, I'll first imagine for one minute: \"What would the sensation be if I were already in the completed state?\" Then I'll ask: \"Does this choice make me more authentically myself?\" In that moment, I will experience the result choosing the cause.\n\n",

    "content": "\nThrough practicing **'meta-routines that improve routines'** in investment study and exercise, I've come to realize something: Why do people with perfect routines hesitate when facing 'business'?\n\nThe answer is simple: business and investment operate in **opposite directions of energy**.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Defining Business and Investment: Offense and Defense\n\nIn the game of capitalism, business and investment serve as 'offense' and 'defense' respectively.\n\n| Aspect | Nature | Core Competency | Point of Success |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Business** | **Offense** | **Offer** | When you throw an irresistible proposal |\n| **Investment** | **Defense** | **Patience** | When you wait until you cannot help but buy |\n\n### 🥊 Business: The 'Offensive' Act of Throwing Irresistible Offers\n\nBusiness is active. Even when the market shows no interest in me, I must constantly throw 'jabs' at the market. These jabs are **offers**.\n\nAn entrepreneur once said something that comes to mind: \"Don't beg customers to 'please buy.' Instead, make them feel 'I'll lose out if I don't buy this.' That's a real offer.\"\n\n- Good sellers don't beg.\n- They design value so that customers feel **\"I'll lose out if I don't buy this\"**, making them buy without selling.\n\nBusiness success doesn't depend on how many offers you throw, but on how many offers become irresistible. This is the essence of offense.\n\n### 🛡️ Investment: The 'Defensive' Art of Waiting Until You Cannot Help But Buy\n\nInvestment is the aesthetics of passive patience. Without being swept away by market frenzy, I wait—even if it kills me—until prices align with my principles.\n\nAn investor once said something I remember: \"When the market goes crazy, there's only one thing I need to do. Nothing. Wait. Wait until the market comes to its senses.\"\n\n- Good buyers don't rush in first.\n- They wait until market panic or inefficiency forces others to sell assets **'at fire-sale prices'**, then capture value.\n\nInvestment success doesn't depend on how much you buy, but on how long you wait. This is the essence of defense.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why Solo Entrepreneurs Must Sell 'Data', Not 'Function'\n\nThe most common mistake when designing business routines is obsessing over 'function'. However, the smaller the business, the more impossible it becomes to gain functional advantage.\n\n> **Function is a recipe (Logic); data is aging (Time).**\n\n### The Limits of Function\n\n1. **Function is replicable:** No matter how excellent your web service or app feature, teams with capital and manpower will catch up quickly. (Diminishing marginal utility)\n2. **Function loses value over time:** Yesterday's innovation becomes today's standard as technology advances.\n\n### The Exclusivity of Data\n\n1. **Data is exclusive:** If you've systematically collected data in a specific domain (e.g., global corn prices, urgent property listings in a specific region) for a year, no one can recreate 'yesterday's data' today.\n2. **Rights create value:** Real estate agents are expensive not because they're friendly (function), but because they have exclusive property information (data) and the right to broker deals.\n3. **Time amplifies data's value:** Data becomes more valuable as it accumulates and ages. Historical data becomes irreplicable historical records.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Business Routines for Value Investors\n\nJust as value investors read endless reports before pressing the buy button, aspiring entrepreneurs endlessly prepare (building websites, designing logos) before throwing offers.\n\nA mentor once said something that comes to mind: \"Preparation is important. But if you only prepare, it's not a business. Business starts when offers meet the market. Until then, it's just preparation.\"\n\nBut **business revenue only occurs when offers meet the market.**\n\n### 🚀 A New 'Meta-Routine' for Entrepreneurs\n\n1. **Internal Routine (Function):** Automate data collection and processing as your private internal system. (Use only as an efficiency tool, not for sale)\n2. **External Routine (Offer):** Based on collected data, throw 'irresistible proposals' to the market every week.\n3. **Improvement Routine (Meta):** Collect market rejection data to sharpen your offers.\n\nThese three routines create a virtuous cycle that reinforces each other. Data accumulated by the internal routine makes the external routine's offers powerful, and feedback from the external routine refines the internal routine through the improvement routine.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Conclusion: Becoming the 'Major Shareholder' of Yourself as a Company\n\nIf I've protected assets through **'routines of not buying'** in investment, I must create value through **'routines that make people buy'** in business. As a solo entrepreneur, my focus is clear.\n\n**\"Use function for internal efficiency; offer exclusive data and rights externally.\"**\n\nThis is the only way to master both offense and defense in capitalism. Protecting assets through investment patience and creating value through business offers. When I execute both simultaneously, I truly become a master of the capitalist game.\n\n---\n\n**Next Step:** Among the routines I currently have, what data would become something someone 'cannot help but buy' after accumulating it for a year? I'll record the first log of that data today.\n\n\n",

The Cosmic Meaning Contained in a Single Screw\n\nIn this book, a 'stripped screw head' is not merely a state of poor maintenance. It is the **point where technology and human subjective values collide**.\n\n### Stuckness\n\nThe moment a screw won't budge, I am ejected from the world of manuals. The frustration that arises at this moment is actually the **'gateway to enlightenment'** that can break existing fixed ideas.\n\nA sentence Pirsig wrote comes to mind: \"When a screw won't budge, you have two choices. Get angry, or listen to what this moment is trying to teach you.\"\n\n### The Test of Attitude\n\nHow we approach a single screw is how we approach life. Handling a screw carelessly is like abandoning the **'Quality'** of one's own life.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Meaning of 'Becoming One' and How Reason Interferes\n\nWhy do I find it difficult to feel unity with objects or tasks?\n\n### State of Separation vs. State of Unity\n\n| State | Characteristics | Result |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Separation** | Viewing the machine only as an 'object' to be fixed, remaining as an 'observer' | Alienation and anger arise |\n| **Unity** | The boundary between self and machine disappears. The resistance felt at the fingertips becomes one's own feeling, and one intuitively knows what to do next—the state of 'flow' | Peace of mind and intuitive understanding |\n\n### Why Reason Interferes\n\nWestern **analytical reason** is fundamentally like a 'knife'.\n\n1. **Dissection and Disconnection:** Reason cuts and categorizes objects to understand them. However, vitality and 'Quality' exist only when the whole is connected as one.\n2. **Dualistic Thinking:** By thoroughly separating \"the thinking self\" and \"the observed object,\" it blocks emotional communion.\n3. **The Trap of Labels:** The moment I attach a name like \"this is an engine,\" I see only the 'concept' I created, not the reality of that existence.\n\n---\n\n## 3. 'Quality' That Is Invisible Yet Felt\n\nThe **Quality** that Pirsig speaks of resonates with the Eastern concept of **Tao (道)**.\n\n### A Priori Reality\n\nIt is **'pure experience'** that already exists before recognizing and analyzing any object.\n\n### Dynamic Quality and Static Quality\n\n- **Dynamic Quality:** The constantly changing reality\n- **Static Quality:** Knowledge that fixes and systematizes this\n\nOnly when these two harmonize does 'goodness' come to completion.\n\n### The Manifestation of Mind\n\nQuality is the state where inner peace manifests as material perfection.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Practices for Remaining in the State of 'Quality'\n\nHow can we set aside analytical reason and become one with the object?\n\n### Practical Methods\n\n1. **Welcome Stuckness:** Instead of getting angry when problems won't solve, treat it as an opportunity to break free from fixed ideas.\n2. **Restore Care:** The mind that sincerely tends to the object breaks down the wall between subject and object.\n3. **Manage Gumption (Psychological Energy):** When my mind is anxious or exhausted, I stop working. Only when the inner self is quiet can the signals of objects be heard.\n\nSomething Pirsig wrote comes to mind: \"When you lose gumption, you must stop working. If you keep pushing, you'll only break things more. You must wait until your mind becomes quiet.\"\n\n4. **Return to Sensation:** Stop the thought \"this is such-and-such\" and focus solely on the sensations of **'this very moment'**—the touch at your fingertips, sounds, smells.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Conclusion: The Power to Endure the Nameless State\n\nSeeing objects as they are is difficult. However, through the practice of erasing 'names' and filling with 'sensation,' I was able to reconnect with the world.

    "content": "\nIn a world where AI agents possess the capability for recursive self-improvement, the pace of technological evolution has long since bypassed the linear learning curves of human beings. As the gap between machine output and human effort widens, I faced a fundamental question:\n\n> When machines can eventually outperform humans in almost every measurable task, how do we maintain a meaningful, collaborative relationship with technology?\n\nThe answer lies not in trying to compete with AI on its own terms—speed, volume, or computational power—but in recognizing and cultivating the three core dimensions where I remain irreplaceable.\n\nThese aren't just advantages; they're fundamental differences in kind, not degree.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Power of \"Low-Power\" Intelligence\n\nWhile AI models require massive data centers and gigawatts of energy to process complex reasoning, the human brain remains the most efficient computing device in the known universe.\n\n### The Efficiency Gap\n\nThe human brain operates on approximately **20 watts of power**—barely enough to light a dim bulb. In contrast, training and running advanced AI agents requires specialized hardware (like H100 clusters) that consumes thousands of times more energy to achieve similar cognitive feats.\n\nAn AI researcher once said something I remember: \"For our model to do something that the human brain can't even do at 1% capacity, it needs thousands of times more power than the human brain. This isn't just a technical problem. It's a fundamental difference.\"\n\nThis isn't just a technical curiosity; it's a strategic advantage.\n\n### The Strategic Edge\n\nIn a future where energy efficiency becomes a primary constraint for scaling technology, my ability to derive \"high-context\" insights from \"low-energy\" input is a vital asset. My biological hardware allows me to:\n\n- Survive, adapt, and innovate without needing a power grid\n- Make critical decisions in the field when infrastructure fails\n- Operate when resources are scarce\n\nI am the ultimate \"decentralized\" intelligence.\n\nThis efficiency extends beyond mere power consumption. I process information holistically, drawing connections across domains that would require separate AI models and massive computational resources. As a single human, I can integrate visual, auditory, emotional, and contextual information in real-time, synthesizing insights that would require orchestrated teams of specialized AI agents.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Sensing \"Quality\" Beyond Logic\n\nMachines excel at processing data, but I excel at sensing Quality. As explored in Robert Pirsig's *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*, Quality is a pre-intellectual reality—it is the \"event\" at which the subject and object meet.\n\nThis isn't mysticism; it's a biological capacity that AI fundamentally lacks.\n\n### The Aesthetic of Being\n\nWhether it is the architectural \"wholeness\" described by Christopher Alexander or the intuitive mastery found in *Zen in the Art of Archery*, I possess a biological sensory system for what \"feels right.\"\n\nThis sense operates:\n- Before rational analysis\n- Before statistical evaluation  \n- Before logical deduction\n\nIt's the gut feeling that tells you a design is off-balance, a melody is incomplete, or an argument is missing something essential.\n\n### The Role of the Curator\n\nAI can generate endless variations, but it cannot truly care about the result. It can optimize for metrics, but it cannot feel:\n- The weight of a decision\n- The resonance of an idea\n- The soul in a piece of work\n\nA designer once looked at an AI-generated image and said something that comes to mind: \"The image is perfect. But something's missing. There's no soul. I can tell what it is. I can feel it.\"\n\nI act as the ultimate arbiter of value, sensing the difference between what is technically correct and what is meaningfully right.\n\nThis capacity for Quality becomes increasingly valuable as AI floods the world with content. In an ocean of AI-generated text, images, and code, the human ability to recognize and create work that truly matters—work that has depth, resonance, and authenticity—becomes a rare and precious skill.\n\nI don't just evaluate; I experience, and that experience guides me toward what deserves to exist.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The Irreplaceability of Unique Experience\n\nI am a unique biological organism shaped by a specific, unrepeatable trajectory through time and space. This isn't poetic sentimentality; it's a fundamental source of value in the AI era.\n\n### Embodied Context\n\nAn AI agent is trained on the aggregate of human history, but it lacks a personal history. It has never:\n\n- Felt the sting of a cold wind\n- Experienced the specific grief of a lost relationship\n- Known the physical adrenaline of a high-stakes decision\n- Made a mistake that cost everything\n- Experienced the slow dawning of understanding that comes from years of struggle\n- Felt the particular texture of a moment that changes everything\n\nA writer once said something I remember: \"AI has read every book, but it has never fallen in love. It has never stayed up all night because of failure. That's the difference.\"\n\n### The Value of the Individual\n\nIn the AI era, \"general\" knowledge is a commodity. However, my specific intersection of experiences forms a proprietary dataset that no agent can replicate:\n\n- The books I've read\n- The places I've lived\n- The failures I've endured\n- The relationships I've navigated\n\nThis isn't just data; it's wisdom, perspective, and judgment forged in the crucible of lived experience.\n\nCollaboration with AI should not be about following its lead, but about using the agent to amplify my unique, lived perspective. The most powerful human-AI partnerships emerge when I bring my irreplaceable context—my specific problems, my particular insights, my unique vision—and use AI as a tool to explore and express what only I can know.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: From Competitors to Composers\n\nThe mindset required for 2025 and beyond is not one of defensive competition, but of creative orchestration. I must stop trying to be a \"faster\" machine and start being a \"deeper\" human.\n\nBy leveraging my:\n- Energy efficiency\n- Innate sense of Quality\n- Unique life story\n\nI don't just work with AI—I provide the direction and soul that AI lacks.\n\nThe future belongs not to those who can process the most data, but to those who can. I can:\n- Sense what matters\n- Integrate experience into wisdom\n- Bring the irreplaceable perspective of a life fully lived to the partnership with artificial intelligence\n\nIn this collaboration, I don't become obsolete—I become essential. I become the composer who gives meaning to the symphony that AI can play, but cannot conceive.\n\n\n",
