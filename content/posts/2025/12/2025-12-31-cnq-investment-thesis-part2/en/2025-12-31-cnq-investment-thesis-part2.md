---

## 0. Overview: Summary of Part 1 and Purpose of Part 2

While Part 1 covered CNQ's overwhelming production volumes and low-cost structure, Part 2 analyzes how those costs are calculated and the practical impact of recent vertical integration and regulatory environment on enterprise value.

Key points from Part 1:
* **Production**: Record quarterly production of 1,620,261 BOE/d achieved
* **Operating Cost**: Low-cost structure of $21.29(CAD) per barrel
* **Cash Generation**: Adjusted Funds Flow of $3.9 Billion (CAD) per quarter
* **Target Price**: CAD 52.05 (+14.4% vs. current price)

Part 2 provides an in-depth analysis of how these figures were calculated and the structural impact of operational efficiency and vertical integration on enterprise value.

## 1. The Reality of Operating Cost: The Secret Behind $21

The oil sands mining and upgrading cost of **$21.29** mentioned in the business report is based on **Canadian dollars (CAD)**. (Approximately **US$15.46** when converted to U.S. dollars)

### Calculation Method

This is the cash cost per barrel, including the entire process from mining to upgrading bitumen into synthetic crude oil (SCO).

### [Table 1] Operating Cost Structure Analysis

| Component | Description | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mining Cost** | Bitumen extraction cost | Oil sands mining and extraction process |
| **Upgrading Cost** | Synthetic crude oil (SCO) refining cost | Conversion of bitumen to light crude oil |
| **Energy Cost** | Upgrading process energy cost | Utilization of company-owned natural gas |
| **Total Operating Cost** | **$21.29/bbl (CAD)** | Cash cost per barrel |

### Basis for Low Cost

* **Self-Supplied Energy**: CNQ uses its own natural gas as fuel, significantly reducing energy costs for the upgrading process.
* **Zero Decline Assets**: Possesses a 'factory-type production' structure where additional exploration drilling costs rarely occur.
* **Economies of Scale**: Fixed cost dilution effect through large-scale oil sands mining and upgrading facilities.

## 2. The Meaning of 104% Upgrader Utilization Rate

Generally, 100% utilization means nameplate capacity. Achieving 104% signals the following:

### [Table 2] Utilization Analysis

| Metric | Value | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nameplate Capacity** | 100% | Expected maximum processing capacity at design stage |
| **Actual Utilization** | **104%** | Actually achieved utilization rate |
| **Over-capacity Achievement** | +4% | Exceeding design capacity |

### Maximization of Operational Efficiency

* **Shortened Turnaround Periods**: Maximizing operating days by minimizing planned maintenance periods.
* **Process Optimization**: Improving processes to handle more volume than initially expected limits at design stage.

### Fixed Cost Dilution Effect

As utilization increases, fixed cost burden per barrel decreases, creating an 'operating leverage' effect where profitability improves exponentially.

## 3. Albian Interest Acquisition and Vertical Integration (Value Chain)

Acquiring 100% interest in the Albian oil sands mine from Shell is not simply external growth but **'value chain control'**.

### [Table 3] Vertical Integration Structure

| Stage | Content | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Upstream (Mining)** | 100% acquisition of Albian mine interest | Stable supply of bitumen as raw material |
| **Midstream (Refining/Upgrading)** | Integration with self-owned refining facilities | Reduction of external processing fees and margin internalization |
| **Downstream (Sales)** | Direct sales of synthetic crude oil (SCO) | Enhanced cash flow visibility through control of entire process |

### Practical Effects of Vertical Integration

* **Raw Material Supply Stabilization**: Securing stable bitumen supply through 100% acquisition of Albian mine interest.
* **Margin Internalization**: Reducing external processing fees through integration with self-owned refining facilities (such as Scotford Upgrader).
* **Cash Flow Visibility**: Strengthening resilience to oil price volatility by controlling the entire process from raw material extraction to final product (SCO) production.

As a result, through vertical integration, CNQ has built a 'low breakeven point' that can survive even during oil price downturns.

## 4. Numerical Calculation Basis for Target Price CAD 53.08

This is not a simple estimate but a calculation formula based on 2025 expected performance scenarios.

### [Table 4] Target Price Calculation Basis

| Metric | Value | Calculation Basis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 2.094 billion shares | Based on 2025 Q3 |
| **Annualized Adjusted Net Earnings** | $7.2B (CAD) | Quarterly $1.8B × 4 |
| **Annualized FCF** | $8.0B (CAD) | Quarterly $2.0B × 4 (estimated) |

### A. P/E Perspective (Profitability)

* **Expected EPS**: Annualized adjusted net earnings $7.2B / Shares outstanding 2.094B = **$3.44**
* **Appropriate Multiple**: Applying industry average of 15x (reflecting CNQ's asset life advantage)
* **Calculation**: $3.44 × 15 = **CAD 51.60**

### B. FCF Yield Perspective (Cash Generation)

* **Expected FCF per Share**: Annual FCF $8.0B / Shares outstanding 2.094B = **$3.82**
* **Target Yield**: 7% (based on energy sector blue-chip standards)
* **Calculation**: $3.82 / 0.07 = **CAD 54.57**

### C. Final Weighted Average

* **(51.60 + 54.57) / 2 = CAD 53.08**
* **Upside vs. Current Price**: Approximately **+16.7%** based on CAD 45.49

### [Table 5] Valuation Comparison

| Methodology | Target Price (CAD) | vs. Current Price |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P/E 15x** | 51.60 | +13.4% |
| **FCF Yield 7%** | 54.57 | +20.0% |
| **Weighted Average** | **53.08** | **+16.7%** |
| **Part 1 Calculation** | 52.05 | +14.4% |

## 5. Structural Impact of Canada's Competition Act

The recently amended Canada's Competition Act (particularly Bill C-59) requires strict 'greenwashing' prevention standards for energy companies.

### Regulatory Risk

* **Disclosure Risk**: Massive fines may be imposed if scientific evidence proving environmental improvement performance is insufficient.
* **Legal Liability**: Burden of proof for environmental claims is placed on companies.

### Strategic Response

CNQ is prioritizing capital allocation to substantial technology investments such as carbon capture (Quest CCS) rather than environmental public relations (PR) to respond to this regulation.

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

* **Short-term Cost Increase**: Capital expenditure increase due to carbon capture and storage (CCS) facility investments.
* **Long-term Risk Elimination**: Interpreted as 'survival cost' that preemptively removes regulatory risk.
* **Cash Flow Impact**: Current FCF generation capability ($8.0B/year) is sufficient to offset these regulatory response costs.

> "We continue to invest in carbon capture and storage technology, including our Quest CCS facility, which demonstrates our commitment to responsible energy development."

## 6. Synthesis: The Link Between Operational Efficiency and Value Creation

CNQ has built a 'low breakeven point' that can survive even during oil price downturns through numerically proven operational efficiency (104% utilization) and clear vertical integration.

### Key Summary

1. **Operating Cost Structure**: Low cost of $21.29(CAD) per barrel is based on self-supplied energy and zero decline asset characteristics.
2. **Utilization Optimization**: Achieving 104% utilization means maximization of operational efficiency and fixed cost dilution effect.
3. **Vertical Integration**: Value chain control through 100% acquisition of Albian interest enables margin internalization and enhanced cash flow visibility.
4. **Target Price**: CAD 53.08 from P/E and FCF Yield perspectives (+16.7% vs. current price).
5. **Regulatory Risk**: Exists, but current FCF generation capability is sufficient to offset it.

### Connection with Part 1

The 'asymmetric reward structure' discussed in Part 1 is supported by the operational efficiency and vertical integration analyzed in Part 2. The low-cost structure ($21.29/bbl) and high utilization (104%) provide downside protection, while margin internalization through vertical integration expands upside potential.

In conclusion, CNQ offers an investment opportunity where the physics of operations can be understood and proven numerically.
