excerpt: "I naturally process information in the order C→D→A, reacting to noise before signals. As I became more skilled, I shifted to B→A and eventually learned to focus only on X—the most important work that makes everything else unnecessary."

Consider the image below. Left alone, I tend to process information in the order C→D→A. I react to noise before signals, and even within noise, I'm drawn to strong noise first. I reluctantly process strong noise (C), weak noise (D), and strong signal (A), but then ignore weak signal (B). This tendency was even more pronounced when watching YouTube videos than when working.

When working, I initially processed tasks in the order A to B. A senior colleague once told me: "Don't process the loud things first. Look at the quiet but important things first."

As I became more skilled, my order gradually shifted to B to A. I began prioritizing importance over signal strength. I came to understand that the more important something is, the less visible it tends to be. I prioritize important information found in weak signals (B) and process strong signals (A) later. I avoid processing C and D whenever possible.

I gradually lean towards doing B and avoid doing A as much as possible.

At some point, I saw what's most important in the absence of signals and focused on doing only that. The rest was either unnecessary in the first place, naturally eliminated because I've done X, or prioritized later based on X. I only do the most important X, the least visible, and the rest is left alone.

When it comes to prioritizing tasks, I've learned that the ability to identify X is more effective than the ability to measure the order of A, B, C, D, .... This is because if X works, A, B, C, D, ... will become unnecessary in the first place.

A project manager once said something that comes to mind: "Among all the things we're working hard on right now, there might be only one thing we really need to do. Finding that one thing is our job."
