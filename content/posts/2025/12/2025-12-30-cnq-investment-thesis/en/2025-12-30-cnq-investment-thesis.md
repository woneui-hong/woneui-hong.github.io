## 4. Risk Analysis (Pre-Mortem)

### Regulatory and Environmental Risk

Uncertainty regarding environmental disclosure and potential legal liabilities due to amendments to Canada's Competition Act.

### Asset Value Impairment

Non-cash unrecoverable costs of approximately $0.7 Billion due to increased estimates of future decommissioning costs for North Sea assets.

### Operational Risk

Temporary production shutdown due to FPSO maintenance at the Baobab field in Offshore Africa.

## 5. Synthesis: Why Now?

While current stock prices reflect one-time costs related to North Sea assets and global economic uncertainty, CNQ's fundamentals remain robust.

### Downside Protection

Low operating costs of $21 per barrel and abundant liquidity of $4.3 Billion support the downside.

### Upside Potential

Secured additional zero-decline production capacity of 31,000 bbl/d annually through 100% acquisition of Albian mine interest.

In conclusion, CNQ offers a typical asymmetric investment opportunity where 'heads you win big (Upside), tails you lose limited (Downside Protection)'.
