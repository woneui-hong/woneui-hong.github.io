excerpt: "Understanding the moment lightning strikes the ground, I realized: causes don't create results; results choose causes. I didn't come to make choices; I came to understand the choices I've already made. Here are practical methods for expanding my range of choices through the MOST test and checklists."

I had long believed that past events came together to create who I am now. But understanding the moment lightning strikes the ground completely reversed my thinking.

## 1. Time Flowing Backward: The Result Chose My Past

Among countless electrical charges descending from the cloud, the moment a single one connects with the ground, all other paths disappear, and only that path becomes confirmed as 'the path of lightning.'

That's when I realized. The moment I firmly decided what future version of myself I would become, my past wanderings and suffering were no longer failures. They were re-selected within me as the **'inevitable path'** that was absolutely necessary to create that result.

> "Causes don't create results; results choose causes."

This sentence was not merely a paradox to me, but a message of salvation that allowed me to rewrite my life.

Instead of despairing that I cannot change the past, I discovered the possibility of **redefining the meaning of the past by first claiming the future result**. This became the first method I began to try.

## 2. I Didn't Come to Make Choices; I Came to Understand Them

The words the Oracle threw at Neo in *The Matrix* quenched my long thirst regarding my calling.

> **The Oracle:** "You didn't come here to make the choice. You've already made it. You're here to try to understand why you made it."

I was always lost, not knowing what I should do, but I came to realize that my deep self (Deep Self) had already decided on **'a more authentic me'**.

### What I Tried

All my attempts were not a process of finding new answers, but a process of discovering the **'reasons'** one by one to unfold that massive decision I had already made into reality.

Accepting this fact, my daunting attempts began to transform into excitement. Instead of asking "What should I do?", I began asking: **"What had I already chosen?"**

A mentor once said something that comes to mind: "You already know. It's just hard to admit it. Try this once. Instead of asking what you really want, ask what you've already chosen."

## 3. The Criterion for Confirming What Is 'Truly Me': The MOST Test

Whenever I was confused about what was truly me and what was false, I recalled the **MOST (Mirror-of-the-Self Test)** proposed by Christopher Alexander.

He would show students two objects and always ask them this:

> **Alexander:** "Which one reflects more of your whole self? If you had to become one of these objects, which one would make your soul more at ease?"

### Practical Method

I, too, began asking myself this question before calculating what benefit a choice would bring.

| Question Style | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Old Way:** "What benefit will this choice bring me?" | Hell of calculation and comparison, endless worry |
| **MOST Way:** "Does this choice reflect more of my whole self?" | Immediate intuition, peace of mind |

When I made choices that made me most authentically myself, they transmitted positive vitality not only to me but also to those around me. The mirror that reflected me most deeply was ultimately connected to the universal order that humanity feels in common.

A friend once said something I remember: "When you made that decision, I felt something ease up too. I can't explain it, but it felt 'right'."

## 4. The Tool That Expands Choices: My Own Checklist

I love witnessing the moment when someone's choices, narrowed down, suddenly expand brightly through conversation. That's when I feel alive. My calling was precisely in that **'work of expanding choices'**.

I decided to center the concept of **'checklist'** to implement this value as a concrete business. The checklist I envision is not simply a list of things to do.

> "We are not making forms; we are helping forms unfold themselves." - Christopher Alexander

Like this saying, my checklist is like **the Oracle's finger**, picking out essential things from complex chaos and reopening closed possibilities.

### Structure of the Checklist

I wanted to help people return to a state of **'infinite choice'** through this tangible tool. The checklist I created consists of the following questions:

1. **Result Claiming Question:** "If I were already in the state of having achieved it, what sensation would I be feeling right now?"
2. **MOST Question:** "Does this choice reflect more of my whole self?"
3. **Understanding Question:** "What had I already chosen? What was the reason?"

A client once said something that comes to mind: "Going through this checklist one by one, I felt something blocked inside me release. I could see again what I had originally known."

## 5. The New Trajectory of Life I'm Trying

I decided not to trap myself in narrow frameworks by worrying about 'how' to live. Instead, I'm continuing with the following new attempts.

### Practical Methods

#### 1. Claiming the Result First

I pre-experience the sensation of my calling already being fulfilled, right at this moment. Every morning, I close my eyes for five minutes and imagine what it would feel like if I had already completed my calling.

> "Because I choose to" - Neo

Repeating this sentence, I experience the sensation of the result I've already chosen, right now.

#### 2. Looking at the Mirror That Reflects Me

I ask the MOST question whether each moment's choice projects my essence. Now, whenever I make a decision, before creating a calculation sheet, I first ask my heart: "Does this choice make me more authentically myself?"

#### 3. Unfolding Through Checklist

I make a list of questions that awaken my essence and check them off one by one. Each time I check off a question, I rediscover something I had already known.

A colleague once said something I remember: "Watching you check things off one by one like that, I feel like I could try something too. It's not complicated—just answering questions one by one, right?"

## 💡 Conclusion: When Choices Expand, Vitality Flows

When my choices expanded, my vitality finally began to flow without obstruction. Today, I continue unfolding my calling one by one on the canvas that is Canada.

I hope this article becomes a small window for someone reading it to try **'another attempt'** beyond the methods they already had.

### Summary of What I've Tried

| Method | Core | Practice |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Claiming Results** | First decide the future result, then let that result choose the past | Feel the sensation of the completed state for 5 minutes every morning |
| **Understanding** | Not finding new choices, but discovering the reasons for choices already made | Instead of "What should I do?", ask "What had I already chosen?" |
| **MOST Test** | Instead of calculating benefits, check if it reflects my whole self | Before choosing, ask "Does this make me more authentically myself?" |
| **Checklist** | Pick out the essence from complex chaos and reopen choices | Make a list of questions that awaken essence and check them off one by one |

A mentor once said something that comes to mind: "The best advice is what makes you see again what you already knew. It's not teaching you something new; it's reminding you of what you had forgotten."

**My mirror is now reflecting the future I dreamed of.**

---

**Next Step:** I'll choose one decision I'll make today. Before making that decision, I'll first imagine for one minute: "What would the sensation be if I were already in the completed state?" Then I'll ask: "Does this choice make me more authentically myself?" In that moment, I will experience the result choosing the cause.
