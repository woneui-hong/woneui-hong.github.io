## 0. Overview: The Result of Extreme Capital Allocation

This report analyzes how AMR's business model maximizes per-share value through 'Capital Compression' based on the 2025 Q3 10-Q disclosure materials and current market prices.

## 1. Valuation and Capital Structure

AMR maintains an unusually clean balance sheet even within the mining sector. While the current market cap is approximately $2.65 B at the current share price ($205.40), the actual enterprise value (EV) excluding cash assets is significantly lower.

### [Table 1] Valuation Metrics
| Metric | Value | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Market Cap** | **$2.65 B** | 12,919,308 shares × $205.40 |
| **Enterprise Value (EV)** | **$2.20 B** | Market cap - Net cash ($453M) |
| **Book Value** | **$1.59 B** | Total stockholders' equity |

The price-to-book ratio (P/B) of approximately 1.67x suggests that the market is relatively conservatively valuing the company's physical mine assets and substantial cash holdings.

## 2. The Asymmetry of Cash Flow and Debt

AMR's strongest investment thesis is 'concentrating all cash generated in a nearly debt-free state solely on shareholders.' According to the 2025 Q3 report, the company's financial debt is only $5M, which is approximately 1% of its net cash holdings.

### [Table 2] Cash & Debt Metrics (as of 2025-09-30)
| Metric | Value | Ratio and Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Net Cash Holdings** | **$453.0 M** | Cash($408.5M) + Short-term investments($49.4M) - Total debt($5M) |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCF, 9mo)** | **$27.8 M** | Operating cash($126.0M) - Capital expenditures($98.2M) |
| **Total Debt** | **$5.0 M** | Principal in current liabilities($2.1M) + Long-term debt($2.9M) |
| **Net Cash / Debt Ratio** | **90.6x** | Overwhelming cash advantage relative to debt |

From a cash flow perspective, cumulative FCF for the nine months ended 2025 was approximately $27.8 M. While this is lower than the previous year, this is a result of market price volatility as management mentioned in the report.

## 3. The Rationale for Capital Compression

AMR's 'capital compression' is clearly evident in the **Treasury Stock** line item on the financial statements. As of September 30, 2025, approximately 42% of AMR's issued shares, or 9,518,071 shares, have been repurchased and held in treasury.

- **Treasury stock repurchase cost:** Approximately $2.23 B
- **Current market cap:** Approximately $2.65 B

In other words, the company has **spent an amount equivalent to the entire current value of the company ($2.23 B) to buy and eliminate shares from the market**. This creates powerful compression that mechanically increases earnings per share (EPS).

Management justifies this strategy as follows:
> "We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program, which we believe represents the most attractive investment opportunity available to us."

## 4. Conclusion

AMR is investing the cash generated each quarter into share repurchases on top of a strong defensive position of $453 M in net cash. As of the end of Q3 2025, shares outstanding were 12.92 million, down approximately 100,000 shares from 13.02 million at the end of 2024.

This capital compression proceeding in a situation with a debt ratio of 0.01x is completing a 'mathematical leverage' that can cause per-share value to explode upward if metallurgical coal prices rebound even slightly in the future.
