## [Part 4] CNQ Valuation: The Reality Behind 'Upside is Open' - The Threshold of Shareholder Returns

---

## 1. Overview: Beyond Simple Growth - 'A Waterfall of Cash'

Many investors only expect profits when oil prices rise. However, CNQ's true 'upside' explodes when external variables like oil price increases meet internal variables like **changes in return policies due to debt reduction**. This analysis examines where that threshold lies through business report figures.

## 2. Upside Catalyst Through Numbers: The Magic of Production per Share

CNQ does not simply focus on extracting more oil, but concentrates on maximizing **Production per Share**.

### [Table 1] Production Growth Analysis

| Metric | Value | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Q3 2025 Production** | 1,620,261 BOE/d | 19% growth YoY |
| **Production Increase** | ~257,000 BOE/d | Absolute YoY increase |
| **2025 Production per Share Growth Target** | 12%~16% | Annual per-share growth rate target |

* **Overwhelming Production Growth**: Achieved **19% growth (~257,000 BOE/d)** in Q3 2025 compared to the previous year.
* **Per-Share Growth Rate Target**: The 2025 annual production per share growth target reaches **12%~16%**.
* **Implication**: As total production increases while share count decreases through share buybacks, the 'amount of oil' owned by each shareholder grows at double-digit rates annually.

> "Operations were strong in Q3/25 as we achieved record quarterly production volumes of 1,620,261 BOE/d, reflecting both accretive acquisitions and organic growth."

## 3. Core Policy: The Shift in Free Cash Flow (FCF) Allocation Policy

The reason CNQ's upside is formidable lies in the stepwise increase in shareholder returns based on debt levels.

> "When net debt is at or below $12 billion, free cash flow allocation will be 100% to shareholder returns."

### [Table 2] FCF Allocation Policy by Stage

| Net Debt Level | FCF Allocation Ratio | Shareholder Return Ratio | Debt Repayment Ratio |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Above $12B** | 100% | 60% | 40% |
| **Below $12B** | 100% | **100%** | 0% |

* **Current Stage**: As of end-September 2025, net debt is approximately **$17.15 Billion**. Currently, 60% of FCF goes to shareholders, while 40% is used for debt repayment.
* **Upside Trigger**: The moment debt falls below $12B, the **40% of cash flow previously used for debt repayment is additionally converted to shareholder returns (dividends and share buybacks)**. This means that even if profits remain the same, shareholders receive approximately 1.6x more cash.

### Numerical Simulation

Assuming current annualized FCF of $8.0B (CAD):

* **Current Stage** ($17.15B net debt): Shareholder returns = $8.0B × 60% = **$4.8B**
* **After Achieving Below $12B**: Shareholder returns = $8.0B × 100% = **$8.0B**
* **Increase**: $8.0B - $4.8B = **$3.2B** (approximately 67% increase)

This increase represents **structural upside** that occurs simply when debt falls below $12B, even without oil price increases.

## 4. Structural Leverage: Costs Fixed, Profits Expanding

Another reason upside is open lies in margin expansion through **vertical integration**.

### [Table 3] Structural Effects of Albian Acquisition

| Metric | Value | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Albian Mine Interest** | 100% secured | Complete vertical integration achieved |
| **Additional Production** | 31,000 bbl/d | Annual basis |
| **2025 Operating Capital Budget** | $5.9B | Additional activities without increase |

* **Effect of 100% Albian Secured**: Recently secured 100% interest in Albian mine, acquiring additional production of **31,000 bbl/d** annually.
* **Capital Efficiency**: Due to execution capabilities and capital discipline, additional activities were performed on a larger asset base without increasing the 2025 operating capital budget ($5.9B).
* **Conclusion**: Entered a phase where production increases without additional cost input (Operating Leverage). When oil prices rise, increased profits are not eroded by costs but flow directly into net income.

## 5. Debt Reduction Scenario: Distance to the $12B Threshold

A reduction of **$5.15B** is required from the current net debt of $17.15B to reach $12B.

### [Table 4] Debt Reduction Scenario Analysis

| Scenario | Annual FCF | Debt Repayment (40%) | Target Achievement Period |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conservative** | $7.0B | $2.8B/year | ~1.8 years |
| **Realistic** | $8.0B | $3.2B/year | ~1.6 years |
| **Optimistic** | $9.0B | $3.6B/year | ~1.4 years |

* **Realistic Scenario**: Based on current annualized FCF of $8.0B, calculating with 40% allocated to debt repayment ($3.2B/year), the $12B threshold can be reached within approximately **1.6 years**.
* **Oil Price Upside Scenario**: If oil prices rise and FCF increases to $9.0B, debt repayment accelerates, allowing target achievement within approximately **1.4 years**.

## 6. Conclusion: "A Business Where the Price of Waiting is Determined"

CNQ's upside is not a vague expectation. It is the result of combining **determined allocation logic** where shareholder portions increase as debt decreases, with **operational strength** that controls costs while increasing per-share value.

### Key Summary

1. **Production per Share Growth**: The 12%~16% annual production per share growth target represents synergy between share buybacks and production increases.
2. **FCF Allocation Policy**: When net debt falls below $12B, shareholder return ratio shifts from 60% to 100%, increasing cash received by shareholders by approximately 1.6x based on the same FCF.
3. **Structural Leverage**: Completion of vertical integration through Albian acquisition has entered an operating leverage phase where production can increase without additional costs.
4. **Distance to Threshold**: Based on realistic scenarios, the $12B threshold can be reached within approximately 1.6 years, with faster achievement possible if oil prices rise.

Ultimately, even if oil prices merely maintain current levels, the era of '100% return ratio' will arrive due to debt reduction. If oil prices also rise, shareholders will face what can truly be called a **waterfall of cash**. This is the true reason why CNQ's upside is said to be open.
